# README.md
This repository contains files to help build a custom version of QGroundControl to work on both Windows and the Cubepilot Herelink devices that modifies the exisiting QGroundControl.

Use the following guides to set-up the environment and build QGroundControl:
* Custom QGroundControl (Windows).pdf
* Custom QGroundControl (Herelink).pdf

This custom version of QGroundControl modifies the existing orbit flight mode functionality by allowing a pilot to control a yaw offset of +-15 degrees when a drone is orbiting, as well as adding the functionality to create an orbit centered around a drone's current position and displaying the orbit radius to give more information back to the user. This is done by modifying the existing user interface and replacing the yaw/altitude joystick with two, one-dimensional sliders.
